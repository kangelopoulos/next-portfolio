        <p>I fell in love with software engineering seven years ago when I picked up data analysis in Python. A few years later, I discovered full-stack web development and it has been my passion ever since.</p>
        <p>Aside from web development, I&rsquo;m also a long distance runner and biker. I love camping, hiking, backpacking, and pretty much anything that involves the outdoors. Nothing quite beats a quiet night in a tent under the stars.</p>
        <p>In my off hours, you&rsquo;d find me road tripping to national parks with my bass fishing rod and my big shepherd mix, Odin, probably with a book about some exciting technology tucked under my arm.</p>
